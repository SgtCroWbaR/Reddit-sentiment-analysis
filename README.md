# Developing a hybrid system that uses fuzzy logic and deep learning for sentiment analysis


Developed a sentiment analysis system that combines the power of a Transformer-based deep learning model with fuzzy logic to provide accurate sentiment analysis results. The Transformer-based model is used to extract features from input text data, and the fuzzy logic system uses these features to assign sentiment scores to input text.


## Transformer-based Model


The Transformer model is a powerful neural network architecture used for natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text generation. It was introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. in their paper "Attention is All You Need" and quickly became one of the most popular models in the NLP community.

It model utilizes the self-attention mechanism to process the input text, which allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence at each step. The self-attention mechanism calculates the attention weights between all the words in the input sequence and generates a context vector for each word based on its relationship with other words in the sequence.

The model consists of several key components:

-   **Input Embedding Layer**: Converts the input text into a vector representation that can be processed by the neural network.

-   **Multi-Head Attention Layer**: Applies the self-attention mechanism to the input sequence, generating a context vector for each word.
-   **Feedforward Layer**: Processes the context vectors generated by the multi-head attention layer, generating output vectors.
-   **Normalization Layers**: Normalize the outputs of the previous layers to help with training stability.


## Fuzzy Logic System


The fuzzy logic system takes as input the features extracted by the Transformer-based model and assigns sentiment scores to the input text. The system consists of a set of fuzzy rules that map the input features to sentiment scores. The fuzzy rules are designed based on expert knowledge and linguistic intuition.

The output of the fuzzy logic system is a set of sentiment scores that represent the degree of positivity or negativity in the input text. The sentiment scores are used to classify the input text into one of three categories: negative, neutral, or positive.
